PLONG
=======
A Lispy Pong Clone. This is my initial game written in ~3 hours.

Requires:
---------
* SBCL
* CL-GLFW3
* CL-OPENGL (includes cl-glut)

TODO:
-----
* Clean up code
* Add velocity increases based on impact locations
* Add UI System
  * Add menu system
  * Better define HUD elements (score, zones, etc.)
* Better Encapsulation
  * Physics
  * Controls
  * Events

Licensing:
-----------
Probably going to be GPLv3, but I need to research compatibilty and restrictions.
So for now, this is licensed under do not copy, do not modify, do not use. Sorry, I will set the license ASAP under something more friendly, however, I need to make sure I won't be hurting anyone when I set it. :(
